                    <ul class="py-5 list-disc ml-8">
                    <li>IRS is not your friend—they are not going to help you or tell you how to help yourself—it is going touse its full enforcement powers to collect an unpaid tax debt.</li>
                    <li>IRS can levy your bank accounts, seize and sell your assets, record tax liens against your property, close your business, and more—these are "Enforced Collection Actions."</li>
                    <li>Unpaid tax debts referred for criminal investigation and prosecution of Federal crimes are on the rise.</li>
                    <li>"Pennies on the dollar" is not a real thing.</li>
                    <li>IRS wants you to pay your balance in full, as soon as possible, and may ask you to liquidate assets todo so.</li>
                    <li>There are alternatives to Enforced Collection Actions, and you need to know what they are and how to use them—they are "Collection Alternatives."</li>
                    <li>If you do not make arrangements to resolve your tax debt, IRS may (after sending required notice)seize funds from your bank account, wages from your employer, Social Security benefits, and from other third parties that owe you money.</li>
                    <li>In determining your ability to pay, the IRS will limit your monthly expenses to amounts it deems necessary to meet living expenses—these are typically lower than actual living expenses.</li>
                    <li>If your balance is over $250,000 (for individuals) or $25,000 (for businesses) a local Revenue Officermay be assigned and can show up at your home or place of business.</li>
                    <li>A Revenue Officer will want to interview you to collect information on potential sources to pay the amount you owe. Providing false information or withholding information on income or assets during this interview is a crime.</li>
