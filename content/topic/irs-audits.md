intro: "Receiving a notice that the IRS is auditing your tax return(s) can be chilling or downright frightening.

At the Center for IRS Help we focus on providing a Smarter Way to handle your IRS audit. We believe that by empowering you, the taxpayer, with knowledge of the process will shield you against being taken advantage of by either the IRS or the many quasi-professional hucksters anxious to take your money and provide little or no truly competent representation in your IRS matter.

Decide first whether you want to represent yourself in your audit. If you do, use the information from our site to tackle your audit on your own. If you decide you want help, contact us. We are here to help."
