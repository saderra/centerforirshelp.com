intro: "The most commonly reported reasons for not filing a tax return include an active duty military service, a lack of competent tax help from trustworthy providers or the abundance of invalid tax advice from so-called tax experts, general confusion or distractions due to family tragedies. In other words, life sometimes gets in the way of filing tax returns and failing to file does not automatically mean that you were intentionally refusing to pay your taxes. The IRS is aware of this and provides systematic ways to bring yourself and your filings current.

Here at the Center for IRS Help, you can access more information on the process to straighten out this issue, including ways to determine your current status with the IRS, communicating with the IRS in a way that prevents legal complications, and accessing the tools to establish repayment terms."
